# Python Operator Augmentation

Python implementation of the methods in our paper "Operator Augmentation for Elliptic Systems,"
as well as a testbed of problems to benchmark performance. This python testbed is substantially less
performant than the C++ implementation, and so is recommended only for prototyping.

## Prerequisites

This testbed requires the Numpy, Scipy, and NetworkX library. I recommend you install the Anaconda distribution of Python.
